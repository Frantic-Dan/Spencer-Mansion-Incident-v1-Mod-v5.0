buffNewbieCoatDescRE,"The Spencer Mansion Incident will give you a unique 7 Days to Die experience like no other mod.\nHere's some information to help you settle in.\n\nThere are no critical injuries, so you don't have to worry about bleeding out, knowing this you can focus on making the most of the limited healing supplies available.\n\nBe mindful of your inventory, don't try to gather herbs or ammo when full, as they will drop on the floor and go to waste.\n\nYou don't have to worry about food and water here, they'll always remain full. However, getting set on fire will make you thirsty. If you become completely dehydrated, then you'll have to drink from a water source and risk getting sick.\n\nZombies can open doors, so never assume you're safe!"

Sorry Alma.\n\nI sit here trying to think of where to begin, of how to explain in a few simple words all that's happened in my life since we last spoke, and already I fail. I hope this letter finds you well, and that you'll forgive the tangents of my pen; this isn't easy for me.\n\nEven as I write, I can feel the simplest of concepts slipping away, lost to feelings of despair and confusion -- but I have to tell you what's in my heart before I can rest. Alma, please believe that what I'm telling you is the truth. The entire story would take hours for me to tell you, and time is short, so accept these things as fact: last month there was an accident in the lab and the virus we were studying leaked.\n\nAll my colleagues who were infected are dead or dying, and the nature of the disease is such that those still living have lost their senses. This virus robs its victims of their humanity, forcing them in their sickness to seek out and destroy life. Even as I write these words, I can hear them, pressing against my door like mindless, hungry animals.\n\nAlma, I have tried to survive only to see you again. But my efforts only delayed the inevitable; I am infected, and there is no cure for what will follow - except to end my life before I lose the only thing that separates me from them.\n\nMy love for you.\n\nIn an hour I'll have entered my eternal sleep where there is peace.

There are only two people that know the secret of this mansion, Sir Spencer and myself. If they kill me, Sir Spencer will be the only person that knows the secret. But for what purpose?

Raccoon police assume it to be a grizzly or other animal's doing because there are teeth marks along her mutilated arms and left foot that show considerable power.

Plant42ReportTip,"Four days have passed since the accident. The plant at Point 42 is growing at an amazing rate.\n\nAlthough there are many unknown aspects about this plant, we know that in comparison with the other group of plants, the T-Virus has had a substantially stronger affect on this one.\n\nThe T-Virus has drastically morphed its host's anatomy as well as its size. Looking at its current state, it's difficult to imagine its original appearance. Nowhere on Earth will you find anything like it.\n\nWe've also found that PLANT 42 has two main sources of acquiring its necessary nutrients. One source is through its root. Somehow it has rooted itself down into the basement.\n\nImmediately after the accident, a scientist went mad and destroyed the Aqua Ring. Ever since, the basement has been like a pool. There is a high possibility that it's one of the chemicals in the water that's promoting the PLANT 42's rapid growth.\n\nHowever, we have yet to determine the specific chemical.\n\nA bulb-like body of the PLANT 42 has been sighted hanging from the ceiling of the first floor. We are sure that it used the air ducts to reach the first floor. Numerous long tentacle-like vines are protruding from the bulb.\n\nWe believe the vines are the second means of acquiring its nutrients. When the PLANT 42 senses prey, it uses the tentacle-like vines to capture its prey. After doing so, suckers on the vine drain the prey of its blood.\n\nWe've also noticed that it has some intelligence. When it captures its prey or when it's inactive, the vines twine around the door to stop possible intruders.\n\nUnfortunately, several of our scientists have already fallen victim to this PLANT 42. When we heard the stories from the survivors, they all observed one thing in common:\n\nWhen the uniform petal-like flaps open and reveal its vital internals, it has a tendency to become more aggressive.\n\nOne witness reported that it was as if it was trying to protect itself. Why it behaves the way it does is still unknown.\n\n21st May, 1998\nHenry Sarton"

If calculations prove correct, when V-JOLT is applied directly to the root of the plant, the entire plant should be dead within 5 seconds.\n\nThe V-JOLT can be made by simply mixing the VP and UMB chemicals in a specific ratio.

Therefore, our most secret research is in danger of public disclosure. Quick actions are demanded to prevent mass media coverage.\n\nThird concern\nThere is a high possibility that most of the specimens are running loose inside the compound. We expect many casualties to follow.\n\nHowever yet unfortunate, these casualties underscore the success of our research results. Actions must be taken to prevent our research results from being made public.\n\nWe suspect the first official intervention will come from the State Police and S.T.A.R.S. We strongly recommend taking measures against them first."

TrainingInformationTip,"Your training perks - More in-depth details:\n\nChemist Expert:\nAllows you to craft a lot more ammo with great gunpowder efficiency. Also allows you to dismantle unwanted ammo without losing any resources.\n\nPassive Healing:\nYou heal 900 health per hour, as long as you're not at full health. Great for a long playthrough, bad for speedrunning.\n\nMedical Knowledge:\n35% more medical healing is great for maximising your healing supplies as well as mid-combat healing. Better for speedrunning than Passive Healing is.\n\nKnife Training:\nGreatly improves your ability to use the knife, allows you to save more ammo, kill faster and you won't get exhausted as quickly.\n\nCardio:\nYou can run faster and longer, allowing you to get away from fast enemies without getting hit from behind.\n\nPain Tolerance:\nYou are more resilient than most and can survive more hits before succumbing to your injuries."

MeleeCombatTip_title,[4FC3F7]Melee Combat Safety[-]
MeleeCombatTip,"Zombies have full pain resistance, attacking most zombies will apply a 5-second counter attack threshold. Attacking a zombie before the 5 seconds expire will add another 5 seconds to their counterattack threshold (up to 15 seconds). Spacing out your attacks is the safest way to deal with zombies in melee combat.\n\nIf there is a zombie in your path that does not have an active counterattack threshold and you want to move past it, you can avoid taking damage by hitting the zombie while passing by.\n\nDismemberment:\nYou have a 25% dismemberment chance, sprinting attacks and attacking when you have high stamina further increases your dismemberment chance."

These 'seed' pots can be picked up and placed indoors for easier access. They will grow indoors."

Railings on the second floor can be destroyed to help escape danger by falling down a floor.\n\nThere are five Sword doors, but only four Sword keys. Which one do you leave locked?\n\nSticky Grenades will also stick to entities, not just blocks.\n\nWhen it comes to boss rooms, you can't leave until you kill the boss.

CrimsonPreventionTip_title,[4FC3F7]Crimson Head Prevention[-]
CrimsonPreventionTip,"Crimson Heads can't exist if zombies aren't killed, so allowing zombies to live where convenient is one way to avoid unwanted guests. Doors help slow down zombies from catching up to you.\n\nDecapitation:\nThe best chance of decapitating a zombie's head is with a handgun with a suppressor installed (gives a 4x chance), assuming you can find it and choose it as one of your three 'Military Goods' options. Shotgun slugs are the next best option.\n\nRemoval of legs:\nThe best chance to remove a zombies leg is with the shotgun, however it can be a little tricky to do, allow me to explain.\n\nShells and slugs both have a very high chance, but work differently.\nShells require the target to be hurt, the less health remaining on your target, the greater the chance shells have of removing their leg.\n\nSlugs require the target to be at full health, the less health they have, the less likely you'll remove a leg.\n\nIf you're feeling lucky, you can nearly kill a zombie with your knife, then use your handgun on their leg."
